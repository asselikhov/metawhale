  affectedUsers: ["942851377"],
  tokenLoss: "0.6 CES (approximately)",
  
  description: `
    When users cancel P2P trades that use smart contract escrow, the refund process 
    only updates database balances but does NOT actually refund tokens from the smart contract.
    This causes tokens to remain locked in the smart contract while the database shows
    they have been refunded to the user.
  `,
  
  rootCause: `
    The refundTokensFromEscrow() function in escrowService.js was missing smart contract
    refund logic. It only handled database balance updates, unlike the releaseTokensFromEscrow()
    function which properly handles both database updates AND smart contract operations.
  `,
  
  evidence: {
    userReport: "User 942851377 sold 1.3 CES, cancelled trade, but only got 0.7 CES back (should be 2.0 total)",

        1. Check if trade used smart contract escrow by looking for EscrowTransaction with smartContractEscrowId
        2. If found, call smartContractService.refundSmartEscrow() with user's private key
        3. Log transaction hash from smart contract refund
        4. Create proper EscrowTransaction record with smart contract details
        5. Handle errors gracefully with manual intervention warnings
